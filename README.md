# Readme
The script run_analysis.R is the only script required and it should be placed in the "UCI HAR Dataset" directory (containing the "test" and the "train" folder) and the working directory in R should be changed to this directory. Most files which came with the original data are required, so please retain them in the same locations.

The Codebook.md file gives an overview of the data & the variables and a general idea of how things are organized. The code in run_analysis.R also has enough comments to get an idea of what's being done. 

Thanks :-)
